1.Make a simple useful Java console application that uses a heap structure.


2.Document your application .
Introduce what it is.
=This Java console program shows how to create a basic priority queue using a min-heap. A priority queue is a way to organize items so we can take out the most important one first. In this setup, I use a min-heap, which means the smallest item is always on top.
Describe what it can do.
=The application lets users use a command line to work with the priority queue. Users can do these tasks:
- Insert: Add a new number into the priority queue. The system will place it in the right spot to keep the min-heap order.
- Extract Min: Take out the number with the highest priority (the smallest number) from the priority queue. After that, the system will rearrange the heap to keep the min-heap order.
Why did you make that  kind of application and how does it contribute to you or to the community.
=This application teaches me about heaps and priority queues. These are basic tools used in computer science. By trying out the code, we will learn how to use and create these tools. This knowledge is useful for many programming jobs, especially when we  need to sort and find data quickly based on its importance.
